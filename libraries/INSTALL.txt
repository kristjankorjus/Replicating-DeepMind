How to install things in this folder.

***there is no reference in the ALE manuals about installing in Windows, so I'm not sure how and if it is possible (should be, as it is written in C++)

1.###PREREQUISITES###:
For our purposes we want to extract screen images from the games. To do so, we need to first install the following Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) libraries:

1.1)libsdl-gfx
1.2)libsdl-image

In Ubuntu you can find them all in synaptic package manager (download the -dev libraries)
If you are using Windows, I guess you have to search the web yourself.
If you are using Mac, ask Ilya.

2.### ALE is in libraries/alte_0.4.3 ###

3.###INSTALL###
We have two sub-folders "ale_0.4.3" and "ale_java_agent".
Go to the folder ale_0.4.3 and open it in terminal.

On UNIX machines do:

		.../ale_0.4.3> cp makefile.unix makefile

	now open makefile in an text editor and change the seventh line from "USE_SDL:= 0" to "USE_SDL:= 1". This tells the compiler to use 		the SDL libraries we installed before. 

	Then do
		.../ale_0.4.3> make


On MACs do (though i think the previous one might work too):

		.../ale_0.4.3> cp makefile.mac makefile
	
	now open makefile in an text editor and change the seventh line from "USE_SDL:= 0" to "USE_SDL:= 1". This tells the compiler to use 		the SDL libraries we installed before. 

	Then do
		.../ale_0.4.3> make

On Windows, I am afraid no information is provided.

YOUR ALE SHOULD BE UP AND RUNNING NOW!!! BRAVO!! 


4. ###Get ROM images and run them###

ALE is not worth much without the Atari 2600 games to play. Unfortunately, the game binaries (ROM files) are not included in the program and need to be downloaded manually. For this many sites exist (Google it!), for example I used ROMs from 
	http://coolrom.com/roms/atari2600/s/     and   http://atariage.com/2600/roms

However, ALE is not capable of playing any game listed on those sites, a list of games supported by ALE 0.3 (so we can expect them to be supported by later versions as well) is given on 
	http://yavar.naddaf.name/ale/

Let's now proceed supposing you have downloaded the Breakout game from http://atariage.com/2600/roms/Breakout.zip and unzipped it.
	1)Now create a new folder called "roms" in your ".../ale_0.4.3" directory are and copy the binary (.bin or .A26) file to this folder. 
	2)change the name of the binary file (no matter the extension) to match the name of the game given in the list of games supported (cf above). The capital letters are important! So in the case of Breakout.bin, we need to change it to breakout.bin
	3)return to the .../ale_0.4.3> folder and run the breakout game with a random agent playing it, and with the option to see the game as it progresses:
		ale_0.4.3> ./ale -game_controller internal -player_agent random_agent -display_screen true roms/breakout.bin
